$Each\ problem\ is\ worth\ seven\ points.$

\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with circumcentre $O$.  
Let $P$ on $BC$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$.  

Suppose that $\angle BCA \ge \angle ABC + 30^\circ$.  

Prove that $\angle CBA + \angle COP < 90^\circ$.

\item Prove that  
$\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2 + 8bc}} +
\frac{b}{\sqrt{b^2 + 8ca}} +
\frac{c}{\sqrt{c^2 + 8ab}} \ge 1$  
for all positive real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$.

\item Twenty-one girls and twenty-one boys took part in a mathematical contest.
\begin{itemize}
\item Each contestant solved at most six problems.
\item For each girl and each boy, at least one problem was solved by both of them.
\end{itemize}

Prove that there was a problem that was solved by at least three girls and at least three boys.

\item Let $n$ be an odd integer greater than $1$, and let $k_1, k_2, \dots, k_n$ be given integers.  
For each of the $n!$ permutations $a = (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)$ of $1,2,\dots,n$, let  
$S(a) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} k_i a_i$.

Prove that there are two permutations $b$ and $c$, $b \ne c$, such that $n!$ divides $S(b) - S(c)$.

\item In a triangle $ABC$, let $AP$ bisect $\angle BAC$, with $P$ on $BC$, and let $BQ$ bisect $\angle ABC$, with $Q$ on $CA$.

It is known that $\angle BAC = 60^\circ$ and that  
$AB + BP = AQ + QB$.

What are the possible angles of triangle $ABC$?

\item Let $a,b,c,d$ be integers with $a > b > c > d > 0$. Suppose that  
$ac + bd = (b + d + a - c)(b + d - a + c)$.

Prove that $a + b + c + d$ is not prime.

\end{enumerate}
